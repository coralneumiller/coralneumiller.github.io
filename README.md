Easton traffic  

### 360

project description 

Easton is a small town located next to Interstate 90 in Washington that many people have not heard of. The K-12 school and playground is separated from the freeway by a chain link fence. On the playground the decibel level is 94 decibels, and the safe limit is 85 decibels, which means children are at risk for a temporary or permanent hearing loss. For a solution, we want the Department of Transportation to build a wall. A wall can be used as a sound barrier. According to the Washington State Department of Transportation the most effective strategy for blocking out sounds is a barrier, “Any applicable area predicted to have a future traffic-noise level of 66 decibels (dBA) or greater, qualifies as an impacted area. Research shows that above 66 dBA, a conversation between two people standing three feet apart and speaking in a normal voice is impaired.” If we were to build a wall we could block out traffic noise and decrease the decibel level so we will not be at risk.
